# 🚀 Mastering C — From Basics to Advanced

Welcome to **Mastering C**, a comprehensive and hands-on repository designed to help you **learn, understand, and master C programming** — one concept at a time.

This repository covers everything from your first “Hello, World!” program to advanced concepts like **pointers, arrays, structures, and recursion**, along with **dozens of practical examples** to strengthen your understanding.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

This repository is organized into **chapters**, each focused on a core C programming concept with multiple **theory files** (`.txt`) and **practical examples** (`.c`).

| Chapter | Topic | Highlights |
|----------|--------|------------|
| **Chapter 1** | Introduction to C | Basics, variables, input/output, first programs |
| **Chapter 2** | Type of Instructions | Data manipulation, operator precedence |
| **Chapter 3** | Decision Making | if-else, nested conditions, switch case |
| **Chapter 4** | Loops & Control Statements | for, while, do-while, break, continue, goto |
| **Chapter 5** | Functions & Recursion | Call by value/reference, recursion examples |
| **Chapter 6** | Arrays | 1D and 2D arrays with real-world examples |
| **Chapter 7** | Pointers | Deep dive into pointer usage and applications |
| **Miscellaneous** | Extra Programs | Linked list, demos, and experimental examples |
